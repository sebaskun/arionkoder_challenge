# Real-World Python ArionKoder Challenges

## 1. Memory-Efficient Data Pipeline

Design a data processing pipeline that:
- Processes a stream of incoming JSON data from a webhook.
- Transforms and aggregates the data using generators and iterators.
- Outputs results to both a database and a message queue.

**Constraints:**
- Must handle variable-rate data influx efficiently.
- Should maintain constant memory usage regardless of input volume.

---

## 2. Custom Context Manager for Resource Management

Implement a robust context manager that:
- Manages connections to multiple external resources (databases, APIs, etc.).
- Provides proper cleanup in case of exceptions.
- Includes detailed logging and performance metrics.

**Constraints:**
- Must support nested context managers.
- Should provide a clear API for resource acquisition and release.

---

## 3. Advanced Meta-Programming

Create a system that:
- Uses metaclasses to enforce a specific API contract across multiple classes.
- Automatically registers classes in a registry upon definition.
- Provides runtime validation of class attributes and methods.

**Constraints:**
- Should support inheritance properly.
- Must include descriptive error messages for contract violations.

---

## 4. Custom Iterator with Lazy Evaluation

Implement a custom collection class that:
- Provides lazy evaluation of expensive transformations.
- Supports common operations like filtering, mapping, and reducing.
- Includes methods for pagination and chunking of results.

**Constraints:**
- Operations should be composable (chaining multiple transformations).
- Memory usage should scale with output size, not input size.

---

## 5. Distributed Task Scheduler

Design a Python-based task scheduling system that:
- Distributes tasks across multiple worker processes.
- Implements priority queues and task dependencies.
- Provides monitoring and status reporting.

**Constraints:**
- Must handle worker failures gracefully.
- Should include mechanisms for task cancellation and timeout.
- Must provide an interface for dynamic scaling of workers.
